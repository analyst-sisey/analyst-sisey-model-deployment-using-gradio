# Deploying-a-Machine-learning-Model Using-Gradio

Introduction

Building a machine learning model is important for practical business decision-making. A machine learning model in a jupyter Notebook or other development tools however does not fully deliver value to users. For a machine learning model to be of practical importance and deliver value to decision-makers, it must be deployed to production. This allows non-technical users to interact with the model for practical decision-making. One of the ways to deploy a machine learning model is to embed it into a web app.

deploying any model using gradio is a simple and efficient way to provide users access to ML models for practical business decision making. The intuitive syntax and user-friendly interface make it a great choice for the deployment of models and other data applications.

Gradio is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning. Embedding a machine learning model into a web app usually requires familiarity with Javascript, HTML, and CSS or other web frameworks such as Django and Flask. Gradio is the fastest way to demo your machine learning model with a friendly web interface so that anyone can use it anywhere. Creating a Gradio interface only requires adding a few lines of code to your project. It allows users to choose from a variety of interface types to interface their function.
